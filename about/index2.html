			<p>Well, "I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist". I like the few people who choose to be interesting instead of being happy. Happiness is for weak. If God exists, it must be powerless (and probably an asshole as well). I'm used to be ironic, sarcastic and sardonic, especially with my life itself. I like provoking - it makes you (and me) thinking. Almost every morning I ask me: "should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?"; I've never drunk coffee, but I'm still alive.</p>
