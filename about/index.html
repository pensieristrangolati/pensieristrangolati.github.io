			<p>Well, "I'd consider myself a realist, alright? But in philosophical terms I'm what's called a pessimist". I like the few people who choose to be interesting instead of being happy. Happiness is for weak. If God exists, it must be powerless (and probably an asshole as well). I'm used to be ironic, sarcastic and sardonic, especially with my life itself. I like provoking - it makes you (and me) thinking. Almost every morning I ask me: "should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?"; I've never drunk coffee, but I'm still alive.

Now. You have just realised that I am above the lines, and a creepy nihilist, thus you have three choices: keep going in your pursuit of easy sluts, keep infecting the world with your ridiculous comments like "your hair is really hot tho"; keep being a slut, just waiting for comments like "your hair is really hot tho" at your pics, or trying, for once in your life, to be something more thick.

If you have chosen the third option, we can start talking about something.

Let me guess: aren't you going to write me something anymore, right?</p>
